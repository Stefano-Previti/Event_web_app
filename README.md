# Event_web_app

The "eventwebapp" project aims to assist users through the process of registering and booking a spot at various events. The application provides functionalities for registering events and booking available spots, provided there are still openings. It also allows for registration, login, and logout, enabling the creation of a personal profile for each user, which is stored with a unique email and username.
